Hi, this is Anita Liu (al877), looking at your Assignment A1!

Please revise your A1 solution as we suggest below. Look at each point and revise
according to it before going on to the next. When done, resubmit. THEN SUBMIT A REQUEST
FOR A REGRADE, SAYING SIMPLY THAT YOU RESUBMITTED. This is how we will know to regrade it.
If we donâ€™t get this regrade request, there will be no easy way for us to know that you
resubmitted. Be sure you have set your notifications on the CMS so that you receive an
email when a grade has been changed.

As you can see, you have problems with get_value in toolbox.py, test cases, and main.py.

1. get_value in toolbox.py:
    You are on the right track by using before_first and after_first as helper functions,
    but you are violating the preconditions - double check their specs. The parameter keyword
    of get_value may be a string of length > 1. Can you use your variable 'key' as an argument
    for before_first?

2. test cases:
    The procedure 'test_before_first' crashed when called. Double check function specs.
    Can marker have a length > 1?

3. main.py:
    Is assigning provide_evidence to a variable necessary? 

There may be other issues with this submission. However, we want you to fix the suggestions
that we have made first. You should continue to review your files for correctness.

Please READ the above carefully, REVISE carefully, RESUBMIT, and then REQUEST a REGRADE.
