Hi, this is Anita Liu (al877), looking at your Assignment A1!

Please revise your A1 solution as we suggest below. Look at each point and revise
according to it before going on to the next. When done, resubmit. THEN SUBMIT A REQUEST
FOR A REGRADE, SAYING SIMPLY THAT YOU RESUBMITTED. This is how we will know to regrade it.
If we donâ€™t get this regrade request, there will be no easy way for us to know that you
resubmitted. Be sure you have set your notifications on the CMS so that you receive an
email when a grade has been changed.

Nice work on A1!

Some coding practices to keep in mind:
1. Write test cases before you implement your functions and test as you go.
2. Write concise and useful comments.
3. Start early and ask for help.
